    <h2 class="md-title">Sharing expenses</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this is app is to share expenses and "simplify" the resulting debts. The latter means calculating
      debts in such a way that everyone gets settled up while keeping the number of money transfers to a minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the debts bundled over all the expenses, you should only ask people to actually settle debts
      after all the expenses are in.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also mark an individual expense as 'Settled'. An expense settled individually is taken out of the
      bundled expense and debt calculation.
    </p>
    <h2 class="md-title">Offline use</h2>
    <p>
      This app is designed for offline use. (It's an HTML5 offline app.) Once opened with a network connection,
      you can use the app even when you're offline by just opening the same page in your browser.
      It helps if you bookmark the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current expense sheet is automatically saved in your browser's memory. You can close the application and
      when you open it again in the same browser, the data is reloaded.
      Please note that clearing temporary internet files and such things can wipe away the expense sheet, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      For permanent data storage, you can save an expense sheet to a file -- and sync it to Dropbox for example
      -- and load a sheet from a file. This way you can share data between devices, too.
    </p>
