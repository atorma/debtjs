    <h2 class="md-title">Sharing expenses</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this is app is to share expenses and to "simplify" the resulting debts.
      This means calculating debts so that <i>all</i> expenses are settled as a bundle
      while keeping the number of money transfers to a minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because debts bundled over all the expenses, it's best to ask people to actually pay their debts
      only after all the expenses are recorded. You can, however, set an individual expense as 'Settled'.
      An expense settled individually is taken out of the bundled expense and debt calculation.
    </p>
    <h2 class="md-title">Offline use</h2>
    <p>
      This app is designed for offline use. (It's an HTML5 offline app.) Once opened with a network connection,
      you can use the app even when you're offline by just opening the same page in your browser.
      It helps if you bookmark the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current expense sheet is automatically saved in your browser's memory. You can close the application and
      when you open it again in the same browser, the data is reloaded.
      Please note that clearing temporary internet files and such things can wipe away the expense sheet, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      For permanent data storage, you can save an expense sheet to a file -- and sync it to Dropbox for example
      -- and load a sheet from a file. This way you can share data between devices, too.
    </p>

      If you need more features, such as your friends being able to enter expenses or tracking expenses among multiple
      groups, you might want to look into Settle Up or Splitwise.
