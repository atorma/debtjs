# DebtJS

DebtJS is a simple app for expense sharing and debt bundling. It can handle currency conversions, too. DebtJS runs in your web browser and you can use even when offline.

DebtJS is built using <a href="https://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>, <a href="https://material.angularjs.org">Angular Material</a>, and of course many other great open source modules out there in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>.

You can use DebtJS at http://atorma.github.io/debtjs.
